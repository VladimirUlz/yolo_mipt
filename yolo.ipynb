    "# YOLO11n Model Analysis for Bathroom Object Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook analyzes the YOLO11n model and explains why it was chosen for detecting objects in bathroom scenes, such as bathtubs, showers, mirrors, and more. The focus is on the model's performance, suitability for resource-constrained environments, and potential improvements for our specific application.\n",

    "## Why YOLO11n for Bathroom Object Detection?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Compact Size**: The model is lightweight (~1 MB), making it ideal for edge devices such as smart cameras or mobile systems installed in bathrooms.\n",
    "2. **Real-Time Performance**: Achieves high frame rates even on devices with limited computational resources, ensuring low latency for live detection.\n",
    "3. **Ease of Customization**: Supports transfer learning and fine-tuning for specific datasets, such as bathroom object annotations.\n",
    "4. **Broad Object Detection Capabilities**: Detects multiple objects simultaneously, suitable for diverse bathroom layouts and designs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations and Mitigation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lower Accuracy for Small Objects**: Mirrors or soap dispensers may be challenging to detect.\n",
    "  - **Solution**: Use higher-resolution training images and adjust anchor boxes.\n",
    "- **Limited Pretrained Data**: The default model may lack bathroom-specific training.\n",
    "  - **Solution**: Fine-tune on a custom bathroom dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sample Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input Image:\n",
    "*Bathroom image with a bathtub, sink, mirror, and towel.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output:\n",
    "- **Detected Objects**:\n",
    "  - Bathtub: 95% confidence\n",
    "  - Sink: 88% confidence\n",
    "  - Mirror: 81% confidence\n",
    "  - Towel: 75% confidence\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "YOLO11n is a practical choice for bathroom object detection due to its lightweight architecture, real-time capabilities, and ease of customization. With fine-tuning and proper dataset preparation, it can achieve reliable results for detecting objects in bathroom environments. Future work includes improving detection of smaller objects and testing on diverse bathroom layouts.\n"
